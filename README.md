Database migration and sample front-ends for Northwind database

The EF context and services are designed to work with the default database (use the file in Resources to create it).

There will be an in-memory version to use as a sample dataset for trying out different front-end frameworks without needing a database.

Although the Northwind database is very old - it is still reasonable to use as a base to try out new front-end technologies.
